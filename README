1) Introduction
---------------

The files in this package implement a very basic Lexical Analyser (aka Scanner or Tokeniser). The
bulk of the Lexical Analyser is realised using the GNU Flex program, whilst the rest of it is
implemented using the C++ programming language.

Don't let this last point confuse you! It doesn't mean that the Lexical Analyser can only be used to
recognise C++. It means only what it says - and that is that part of the Lexical Analyser was
implemented using C++.


2) How to process this package
------------------------------

This package is intended to be processed by the GNU Autotools suite of tools, and doing so will
result in the package becoming a GNU Autotools project. This file will explain how to process this
package with the GNU Autotools suite of tools.

To begin, cd to the directory which contains this file, and then execute the following two
commands ;

  > libtoolize
  > autoreconf

The autoreconf command may complain that a number of required files cannot be found. However,
don't worry, because it also informs us that this can be rectified by executing the command ;

  automake --add-missing

Therefore, you should go ahead and execute this command.

If all of these commands executed successfully, then the files should now be setup as a GNU
Autotools project. If this is indeed the case, then a file called configure should have been created
in the same directory as this file.


3) What to do next
------------------

You should now read the INSTALL file for instructions on how to use this configure script. It will
explain how to configure, build, and then install the Lexical Analyser and any of its associated
files.
