Filename : README.setup_autotools_project
*****************************************

This file, along with a number of the files with which it is distributed, are intended to be used
to create a GNU Autotools project. This file will explain how to do this.

To begin, cd to the directory which contains this file, and then execute the following two
commands ;

  > libtoolize
  > autoreconf

The autoreconf command may complain that a number of required files cannot be found, and that this
can be rectified by executing the command ;

  automake --add-missing

So go ahead and execute this command.

If all of these commands executed successfully, then the files should now be setup as a GNU
Autotools project. If this is indeed the case, then a file called configure should have been
created.

Now read the file INSTALL for instructions on how to configure and build this project.
